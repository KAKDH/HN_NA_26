# Final Project Guidelines

## Network Analysis
### An Introduction for Humanists 

Teacher: Dr Katarzyna Anna Kapitan

## **Overview**

For your final assignment, you will work in groups of 3-4 students and collaboratively conduct a mini end-to-end NA project. 

You will submit a **project report** along with a **data asset** that demonstrates your ability to:
- model data in a way suitable for network analysis, 
- apply network analysis concepts, 
- use the NetworkX package in Python, 
- and engage with seminar readings on network analysis in the humanities.

Additionally, you will deliver an oral presentation of your research questions, methodology, and findings in class in Week 8 (10-15 min per group).  

## **Submission Format**
Your submission will be a private GitHub repository consisting of:

1. **Project Report** (1500–2500 words)   
2. **Data Asset** (consisting of unprocessed data, Python code(s), and Network visualisation(s)) 

## **Project Report Requirements**

Your report should be structured as follows:

### **1\. Introduction (10%)**

* Provide a clear research question or objective.   
* Explain why you selected this dataset and how it relates to network analysis in the humanities. 

### **2\. Data and Methods (25%)**

* Use at least the mandatory project reading (Fischer's chapter 'How to Network' from 2025) for inspiration. 
* Describe the raw dataset and how you processed it for analysis.   
* Explain the network construction process (e.g., nodes, edges, weights, directed/undirected network).   
* Discuss any preprocessing, cleaning, or transformations applied.   
* Present the measures you used and explain why they are relevant (e.g., centrality, clustering coefficient, density, modularity). 

### **3\. Results and Discussion (35%)**

* Present key findings from your network analysis.   
* Interpret the meaning of the network structure and measures in relation to your research question.   
* Include and explain at least one network visualisation.   
* Reflect on any challenges faced and decisions made during the analysis. 

### **4\. Engagement with Lectures and Readings (20%)**

* Demonstrate understanding of theoretical and methodological concepts discussed in class.   
* Reference at least two seminar readings relevant to your project and apply their insights to your analysis.   
* Critically evaluate how network analysis helped (or failed to help)  answer your research question. 

### **5\. Conclusion (10%)**

* Summarise the main insights from your analysis.   
* Suggest possible next steps or further questions arising from your study. 

## **Data Asset Requirements**

* **Raw Data**: Provide  documentation for each step of your data processing including the original source files reflecting the unprocessed dataset, as well as the final dataset used for analysis.   
* **Code**: Submit Python scripts or Jupyter Notebook files that document how you processed the data, calculated network measures, and visualised the key features relevant for your research question.   
* **Visualisations**: Include network diagrams with clear labels and legends. 
* **Reproducibility**: Make sure that all your workflows are reproducible, so all the necessary files are deposited in the repo.


## **Evaluation Rubric**

| Criteria | Excellent (90-100%) | Good (75-89%) | Satisfactory (60-74%) | Needs Improvement (\<60%) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Introduction** | Clearly defines research question and relevance of dataset | Research question is clear but needs more justification | Topic is relevant but lacks a strong research question | Weak or unclear research question |
| **Data & Methods** | Thorough description of data processing and analysis; well-justified choice of measures | Mostly clear explanation with some missing details | Methods are described but lack depth or justification | Methods unclear or poorly explained |
| **Results & Discussion** | Strong interpretation of network structure with clear visualisation; insightful discussion | Solid findings with some interpretation gaps | Basic discussion with limited analysis | Weak discussion, little engagement with findings |
| **Engagement with Readings** | Well-integrated references, deep engagement with key texts | Engages with readings but lacks critical reflection | References readings but superficially | Minimal or no reference to readings |
| **Conclusion** | Strong synthesis of findings and future directions | Summarises findings but lacks forward-looking insights | Basic summary without deeper insight | No meaningful conclusion |
| **Data Asset** | Well-organised, reproducible code and clear visualisations | Some minor issues in reproducibility or clarity | Code is functional but lacks comments or clarity | Disorganised or incomplete data assets |


## **Due Date**

All submissions must be sent  to your teacher by email by **1 April, 23:59 (Paris time)**.

Late submissions won’t be accepted and will result in failing the class. 

## **Academic Integrity**

Ensure all sources, including seminar readings and external references, are properly cited. Any form of plagiarism will result in academic penalties according to university regulations. 

Include an GenAI-statement, if relevant, explaining how and which tools you used in the project. 

If you have any questions, please bring them up during the lab sessions. 

**Happy analysing!**
